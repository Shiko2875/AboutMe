            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I am a computer programmer with strong knowledge of Java and Python. During my internship at TKE (Thyssen-Krupp Elevator),
                I worked with the MAX team to conduct network traffic simulations as well as create python scripts for data collection.

                I graduated from Georgia State University with degrees in Computer Science and Statistics. Most of my time spent at GSU was labs
                and creating projects for classes. I created a desktop application that would take a user's Covid-19 symptoms and age. The application would then 
                display the chances that user would become a critical care patient.

                    I love baseball. I had the chance to go watch the Braves playoff game against the Dodgers. I grew up watching the Braves with my dad
                    and he is the reason why I am so into baseball. My favorite <em>talks</em> with my dad are about the Braves and their offseason moves
                    as well as their current form.

                   One of my favorite games to play is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I am currently the highest rank in CSGO. I started playing CSGO when I was a freshman in
                   highschool.

                <p>
                    I also play singleplayer games. I like to collect all the achievements in singleplayer games. If you check my steam profile you will see that I have 100% completion in
                    9 games. I am currently working on getting Hollow Knight to 100%.

                    I just recently finished watching <em>Death Parade</em> which is about an arbiter that judges whether people go to be reincarnated or sent to the void. He completes his judgement by making two people
                    play bar games.
